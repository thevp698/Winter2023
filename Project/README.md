This program is for the project for the course COMP - 579 Reinforcement Learning 

I'm attching a basic .ipynb file for my DQN algorithm implemented for differnt environments.
There are lots of different variants of my program since it took very long to tune the hyperparameters I've different files. This is the base file and I've followed the same 
things for all the other variants. Since, following the code is very confusing I've tried to give overall picture of my code.

In case of any query please feel free to reach me at vraj.patel@mail.mcgill.ca
